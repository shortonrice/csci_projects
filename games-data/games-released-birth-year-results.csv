Along with the original Black Hole army's commanding officers (COs), four new COs were recruited, under the command of Sturm. Sturm orders each Black Hole CO to invade and capture each of the four continents controlled by the four other armies from the original game: Orange Star was to be taken by Flak, Blue Moon by Lash, Yellow Comet by Adder, and Green Earth by Hawke. Lash also invented several new war weapons like the Black Cannon and the Mini Cannons that were to be put to use in this invasion. The four allied armies must now work together to drive Black Hole out of their world once and for all.

Once the Black Hole troops are driven from the Allied Nations' continents, their COs convene in Black Hole territory, near Black Hole's base of operations. Here they fight Sturm, the mastermind behind the invasion. The final battle takes place in front of the Death Ray, a powerful new weapon guarding the entrance to a missile, which, if not subdued in time, would destroy half of Wars World.

The Death Ray is eventually destroyed by the COs of the Allied Nations, who manage to disarm the missile and corner Sturm. In an act of desperation, Sturm attempts to blow up the base and inflict damage on Wars World by self-destructing the missile. Andy attempts to stop Sturm to no avail. However, in a surprising turn of events, Hawke, second in command to Sturm, betrays his leader by killing him with Black Storm before the self-destruct is triggered.

168926,129851,Age of Mythology: Gold Edition,"AoM: 
Like many other real-time strategy games, Age of Mythology is based on defeating enemy units and towns, building your own units and towns, and training villagers and fighters. In this way, players are able to defeat and conquer rival towns and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four ""Ages"": starting in the Archaic Age, the player may upgrade to the Classical Age, the Heroic Age, and finally, the Mythic Age. Each upgrade to a higher Age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthens their settlement. However, upgrading requires a sum of resources to be paid and a certain prerequisite building to be constructed. 
 
There are three playable cultures in Age of Mythology: the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse. Each culture has three ""major gods""—important deities such as Ra, Zeus, or Odin. The player chooses their major god before the game begins. Every time a player advances to the next age, a ""minor god"" is selected. Minor gods are slightly less significant historically than their major counterparts. Some minor gods include Bast and Aphrodite. All gods grant the player unique technologies, myth units, and a unique ""god power""—A one-time special ability that can either damage an opponent, or benefit the player that uses it. 
 
 
AoM - The Titans: 
The story begins with Kronos, who is still trapped in Tartarus, watching the Atlanteans, who are attempting to survive the harsh winters in the Norselands after Atlantis was destroyed 10 years ago in the events of Age of Mythology. He sends his unnamed servant to the colony, who kills the Theocrat Krios and possesses his body. Krios tells of a temple he saw in a vision. The Atlanteans leave the Norselands by using the foreseen temple called a Sky Passage, and they come to a resourceful island. Upon their arrival, Krios points out the plant-covered Temples to Oranos and Kronos. He convinces everyone including Kastor to worship them. This angers the Greeks, who promptly attack them. The Atlanteans retaliate by destroying the entire Greek colony. The survivors tell of their defeat to General Melagius. The Atlanteans invade Melagius' city called Sikyos, and slay him. Just as the Atlanteans kill Melagius, his Egyptian and Norse allies come to aid the city. Kastor decides they are too powerful and retreats. He decides to attack their homelands while they are heavily defending Greece. In the Norselands, Kastor destroys Norse temples and replaces them with Atlantean temples, to show his superiority. He also destroys the Tower of Odin (Odin's only stronghold on Earth) by using a god power from Kronos. 
 
Some Atlantean forces then sail to Egypt. Queen Amanra is warned by Arkantos that the Atlanteans are coming to steal relics from the Egyptians. Amanra fortifies the protections around the relics, but the Atlanteans still manage to steal them. Arkantos protects Amanra from Atlantean soldiers then tells her that Kastor is being tricked. He tells her to find Kastor and to help him. Meanwhile, Krios congratulates Kastor on his work and shows him a Sky Passage that he has found, which will take him behind Greek lines. Kastor enters it and finds himself on Mount Olympus. Using special temples that change his men into different myth units, Kastor slays the followers of the Olympian Gods, including Odysseus. However, once he does this, the temple to Zeus on the mountain collapses. Back in Greek territories, the Titan Prometheus and his army of Prometheans from Tartarus are destroying Sikyos. Krios arrives and announces that Kastor's actions in Greece, Egypt and the Norselands, combined with his invasion of Olympus, have weakened the Olympian Gods' control over these territories and allowed minor titans to spawn. Krios reveals his true form, a winged demon and servant of Kronos, and flees.",2003-09-30 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

167405,1135,Castlevania: Lament of Innocence,"Lament of Innocence is set in the fictional universe of the Castlevania series. Set in 1094, it focuses on the origins of the series' premise—the conflict between the vampire-hunting Belmont clan and the vampire Dracula. The protagonist and primary player character of Lament of Innocence is Leon Belmont, a former baron and member of the Belmont clan. His close friend, Mathias Cronqvist, tells him that Leon's betrothed, Sara, is being held captive by the vampire Walter Bernhard. During the game, he encounters Rinaldo Gandolfi, an alchemist and resident of the forest outside Walter’s castle.

Arriving on the castle grounds, Leon meets Rinaldo, who gives him a whip crafted by alchemy to assist in killing the monsters and enchants his gauntlet so he is able to use magic relics within the castle. Leon also learns that he must defeat five monsters to gain access to Walter's throne room. Arriving at the castle, Leon proceeds to defeat the five monsters, including Joachim, a vampire kept prisoner in the castle by Walter. Before dying, Joachim mentions the Ebony and Crimson Stones, both of which are created from alchemy, and explains to Leon that the Ebony Stone can produce darkness. From Rinaldo, Leon learns that the Crimson Stone converts the souls of vampires into power for its holder.

After Leon reaches Walter’s quarters, he rescues Sara and attempts to slay him with the whip, to no effect. At Rinaldo's cottage, it is revealed that Sara is slowly becoming a vampire. Rinaldo reveals that Leon must sacrifice Sara to make the whip effective against Walter. Overhearing their conversation, Sara begs him to kill her and use her soul to save others from suffering her fate. Leon reluctantly completes the ritual, creating the Vampire Killer whip.

Devastated by the loss of Sara, Leon returns to the castle to confront Walter and defeats him. Death takes Walter's soul and offers it up to Mathias; Mathias appears and reveals he had orchestrated everything to obtain his soul and convert it into power for himself using the Crimson Stone. Mathias explains that he chose immortality as a vampire so he could curse God for taking away his beloved wife. He offers Leon the same, but a disgusted Leon refuses. Mathias orders Death to kill Leon, but Leon defeats Death, vowing that the Belmont clan will hunt down Mathias and destroy him one day. The game's epilogue reveals that Mathias became Dracula, the series' main antagonist.",2003-10-21 00:00:00.000,9,NULL,78.0000,3,79.2965,35

151881,11272,Chaser,"Mars, 2044. The UN establishes MARSCORP (Martian Security and Economics Committee) under the leadership of Samuel Longwood. In the years that follow, the UN gradually loses control of MARSCORP, mainly due to the non-transparent licence policy of its director. Longwood uses his autonomous status to create vassal relations between the corporations and MARSCORP. The unshakable power position of MARSCORP is supported by the companies and thus they acquire additional rights and licenses. Longwood and his consortium become extremely wealthy from this arrangement. However, dissenting voices in MARSCORP begin to challenge Samuel Longwood's authoritarian policy. They demand his dismissal as director and a complete redistribution of the mining rights.
But Samuel Longwood keeps an ace up his sleeve for occasions like this…
John Chaser is a man without memory or friends. Alone, in the middle of a bloody conflict, he is trying to find out who he is. His extraordinary fighting abilities enable him to survive, but they raise more questions than they answer. Chaser awakens on board the spaceship H.M.S. Majestic. He doesn't know who he is, what he's doing here, why he is being sought by men in black uniforms and what they will do to him when they find him…
The player's goal is to find out who Chaser really is and why he is being hunted. The story leads the player from the H.M.S. Majestic to Montack City on Earth, then on to Siberia and finally to Mars, where the trail ends and hopefully the truth can be found.",2003-08-22 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,69.5000,2,64.3749,17

Somehow, it mysteriously reappeared near one of the moons of Jupiter. A team called S.O.A.R. (Special Operations And Reconnaissance) onboard the investigative Probe ship Seyfert are sent to investigate. A smaller shuttle lifts off from the Seyfert to investigate. Suddenly, the supership launches its turbo cannons at the Probe ship, destroying it. It then aims and fires at the shuttle. The weapon causes a large explosion, killing most of the troops and crew members aboard. Fortunately, a few of the team members of S.O.A.R., Patrick Tyler, McCoy, Sonya Hart and commander Jacob Ranshaw, were able to survive the blast and managed to board the ship. What will await them inside is just the beginning, if they can survive, rescue the other survivors and escape the bowels of the mysterious ship.",2003-06-26 00:00:00.000,4,NULL,30.0000,1,NULL,NULL

192449,11610,Disgaea: Hour of Darkness,"The story of Disgaea opens with Laharl rising out of an open coffin in his room. Etna, one of the castle vassals, is standing next to him, surrounded by various weapons. She explains that he has been sleeping for two years, far longer than he intended, and his father, King Krichevskoy, has died. Laharl vows to reclaim the throne, and, after consulting with Etna and his other vassals, goes to Vyers' castle.

After defeating the demon Vyers, who refers to himself as the ""Dark Adonis"" and is renamed ""Mid-Boss"" by Laharl, he meets Angel Trainee Flonne. Flonne had been sent to the Netherworld by Seraph Lamington, the ruler of Celestia, to assassinate King Krichevskoy (who was already dead). Shocked by Laharl's lack of grief at his father's death, the eternally optimistic Flonne joins Laharl's party to determine if demons are capable of feeling love. Observing them in secret is the paranoid Archangel Vulcanus, who interprets Flonne's actions as treason and is convinced that she is plotting against him.

After Etna demands that Laharl pay the salary of the Prinnies that she has hired, he decides to attack the demon with the most money in the vicinity. This is Hoggmeiser at Dinero Palace. After defeating Hoggmeiser, Laharl is about to kill him, until Hoggmeiser's son rushes out and gets in the way. Flonne convinces Laharl to spare them, and Laharl lets them keep some of the money. In response to this act, Hoggmeiser joins the party.

At one point, Flonne and Etna discover a photograph of Laharl in an embarrassing situation. Laharl refers to this as a ""paparazzi shot"", however, the actual contents of the photo are never actually revealed. A threat on the back of the photograph states that copies of it would be distributed if Laharl did not accept a challenge to fight for the overlordship; thus Laharl was blackmailed.

Responding to this challenge, Laharl meets Maderas, a vampire. He was banished by King Krichevskoy, for stealing the King's favorite snack, black pretzels. Maderas takes advantage of Laharl's two biggest weaknesses – optimism and women with sexy bodies. Maderas was also controlling Etna by holding her memory. He had instructed her to kill the prince, but she had put him to sleep for two years by poisoning him instead. Etna eventually betrays Maderas, and along with Laharl, Flonne, and Mid-Boss, defeats him.

Waking up later at night, Flonne discovers that several Prinnies are chanting and leaving the castle. Laharl, worried that his reputation will be tarnished if it is discovered that he let his vassals escape, chases after them the next morning. Eventually, he runs into Death, and the player learns that Big Sis Prinny is actually Laharl's mother; she became a Prinny because she gave her life to save him.",2003-01-30 00:00:00.000,19,NULL,90.0000,2,85.0668,27

DK entrusts Diddy with protecting the hoard until midnight, when he would be relieved, while DK himself goes to sleep as he is tired.

Everything seems to go smoothly in the hoard until Diddy hears some noises. Diddy hears some voices outside and gets scared, asking who's there. King K. Rool, who had commanded his Kremling minions to steal the bananas. Two ropes drop from above and suddenly two Kritters appear. Diddy cartwheels them both easily, but then a Krusha (Klump in the instruction booklet) comes in as backup. As Diddy is not strong enough to defeat Krusha by himself, he is overpowered and defeated by the Kremling. The lizars seal Diddy inside a barrel and then throw it in the bushes.
Donkey's grandfather, Cranky Kong, rushes inside the treehouse to tell Donkey Kong to wake up so he may tell him what happened. He then tells Donkey to check his Banana Cave. Donkey Kong is infuriated, exclaiming that the Kremlings will pay for stealing his banana hoard and kidnapping his little buddy.

As on Earth, this expansion also led to competition and fighting over available resources, but everything changed with the discovery of a natural wormhole leading to an unexplored galaxy subsequently dubbed ""New Eden."" Dozens of colonies were founded, and a structure, a gate of sorts (which bears the inscription ""EVE"" on the New Eden side), was built to stabilize the wormhole that linked the colonies of New Eden with the rest of human civilization. However, when the wormhole unexpectedly collapsed, it destroyed the gate as well as the connection between the colonies of New Eden and the Milky Way. Cut off from the rest of humanity and supplies from Earth, the colonies of New Eden were left starving and disconnected from one another; many died out entirely. Over the millennia the descendants of the surviving colonists managed to rebuild their own societies, but by this time the memories and knowledge of humanity's origins, of Earth and the Milky Way galaxy, as well as the history of the settling of New Eden, was lost; what little information that survived transmission over the generations was misunderstood, lost in translation, and/or consigned to mythology. Five major distinct societies rose to prominence from the surviving colonies, each growing into interstellar spaceflight-capable civilizations.

58302,5827,Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick,"The game begins three years after the events of ""Hail to the King"". Ash Williams is telling the story of his battles with the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis to an Asian man, and then starts to tell the story of how he ended up with the man in the first place through a series of flashbacks.

Dearborn, Michigan: Last Night
A special ""Live"" episode of Mysteries of the Occult starts at the local KLA2 television station (a reference to the movie The Day the Earth Stood Still; KLA2 is pronounced ""Klaatu,"" the name of the protagonist.) Trisha Pettywood, a journalist out to expose the truth of the Necronomicon, is the host, with her guest, the parapsychologist and best-selling author Professor Alex Eldridge, a colleague of the late Professor Raymond Knowby, who has written a book based on the Necronomicon. Ash is sitting at his favorite bar in the red-light district, having a few drinks during the broadcast, and badmouths Eldridge, claiming that he wouldn't know the real Necronomicon from ""a roll of extra-fluffy two-ply"". The bartender, who apparently knows Ash, gives him a free drink, telling him that he is sorry about Jenny, a subject which is apparently still very painful for Ash. Trisha also mentions a local Dearborn man (namely Ash) who claims that the Necronomicon can raise the dead and interdimensionally travel through time, but Eldridge dismisses it as the sad, depraved ramblings of a lunatic, while also claiming that it is easy to get caught up in the book's mythology. Hearing this, a drunken Ash babbles on about his remark, and also about his fights with the Deadites and how he had to amputate his own right hand. Trisha has somehow obtained the tape recording of Professor Knowby, and plays it live as a ""treat"" to the viewers. Ash, knowing what will happen if they do so, shouts at them not to play it, but of course, they do not hear him. The Deadites are released into the world once more, and the Evil Force floats through town, right into the bar, and possesses the bartender who is promptly shot down by Ash who strangely has his boomstick with him.",2003-05-20 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,58.2500,6,NULL,NULL

One day, however, reality intrudes on his life, and he and his friends must leave the safety of home to fight on the blasted surface of Earth.

Exaskeleton is a linear mech-combat game. Each mission in the game is book-ended by long, talking-head dialogue scenes between the various members of Joe's party. Before each mission the model of Joe's (as well as allies, if available) frame can be selected, either the nimble and weak Light Frame, the armored and slow Heavy Frame, or the in between Middle Frame. Two weapon slots are taken up by small arms, either a pistol, machine gun, or grenades, while the other two slots are taken up by more powerful weapons, like missile launchers, sniper riffles, and Gatling guns, with the most powerful only able to be equipped by a Heavy Frame. Weapons have limited ammo and overheat if fired continuously. Each body part of a frame is armored, and after the armor on a part is destroyed any additional damage to that part will damage the frame itself, until eventually the frame is destroyed.",2003-12-18 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

""All God's Village""), a ""[l]ost"" settlement where the majority of the game takes place. The player learns that Minakami Village was host to the ""Crimson Sacrifice Ritual"", the failure of which caused the settlement to vanish—thus earning it the name ""The Lost Village"".

145894,3492,F-Zero GX,"The story starts out with Black Shadow driving down a highway after losing a Grand Prix. Deathborn catches up to him and gives him one more chance to succeed but says it's the only other chance he'll get.

F-Zero GX's story mode continues with Falcon training for the Grand Prix, followed by racing his rival, Samurai Goroh, in a desert canyon and being forced to enter the bet race under the disguise of 'Famicom' (a reference to Nintendo's first home console). After winning said bet race, Falcon notices Black Shadow attacking the Lightning area on the news. Falcon makes his way to stop him, but is delayed by a group of thugs lead by Michael Chain. After dealing with Chain's gang, Falcon enters a facility to save Jody Summer. His escape is a close one as the core was set to overload and detonate, with said facility going into lock-down procedures. With Jody out of harm's way, he confronts Black Shadow. The evil overlord, with the help of Blood Falcon, binds Falcon and traps him inside his vehicle, strapping a bomb to the Blue Falcon that will detonate if the Blue Falcon goes too slowly. Falcon managed to survive, by driving the vehicle straight off an unfinished road and right under a crane, knocking the bomb off.

Falcon later attended the Grand Prix, where he emerged victorious. After receiving the champion's belt, he witnessed Black Shadow being punished by his master, Deathborn, for his incompetence. Deathborn challenges Falcon to a one-on-one race for ownership of both belts. Before said race occurs, Deathborn reveals his plan to take over the universe, revealing the energies of light and dark are condensed in each belt, and that when combined, provide ultimate power that will turn him into a god-like being, able to lay waste Falcon's galaxy in an instant. Falcon swears to take him down. Falcon stays true to his word, and Deathborn apparently dies. Both belts unite into one, and Falcon vows to keep winning so he can protect the belt from the forces of evil.

At his garage, Falcon is greeted by the creators. Falcon figures out the creators were behind everything, though they do not elaborate their motives. They challenge Falcon to a race, where, if they win, will rip out Falcon's soul and turn it into their creation, implying that he would replace Deathborn. Falcon defeats even them. Screaming, the creators disappear, though whether they actually die or decide to let Falcon go, honoring (but no less angered by) his victory is unclear. Falcon then removes his helmet and leaves the room, where the credits and an exclusive theme song begins to play. (The camera pans at a downward angle, so Falcon's face is not clearly visible. Only a portion of his head in the back is partially seen.)",2003-07-25 00:00:00.000,11,NULL,90.0000,3,78.0650,46

There were attempts to destroy it, but all were unsuccessful due to its combat capabilities. 
 
As most Gears should be dormant without Justice's leadership, these news stunned the public. People were terrified by the possible emergence of a second self-reliant Gear like Justice, exarcerbated by rumors of each nation having their own Gears for military use. Driven by an all-time high anti-Gear sentiment, humanity did not want to give up their peace after the hundred year-long Crusades.

NPCs in the game, including the main character's son and wife also grow older as time passes. The game takes place in a new setting for the Harvest Moon series - a small village called Forget-Me-Not Valley, populated entirely by new characters.

Jak, Daxter, Samos and Keira are in the process of activating the rift rider, the precursor device hidden behind the large door at the end of Precursor Legacy, and its accompanying rift gate. When the gate is activated a large figure steps out, accompanied by a swarm of creatures. Jak panics and activates the rift rider, propelling the group through the gate. As they are travelling through the rift, the rider is destroyed. The group fall out of the rift and are separated, though all find themselves in Haven City. Jak and Daxter land and are immediately identified by a patrol of the Krimzon Guard, led by Captain Erol. Jak is taken into custody, as Daxter promises to rescue him (see the events of Daxter). Two years later, Jak is in the Fortress, where he has been the subject of a super soldier program. His body has been infused with dark eco. Erol and the Baron Praxis are there. They declare the 'Dark Warrior Program' a failure. They leave, just as Daxter appears to rescue Jak. As Daxter fidgets with the restraints, Jak transforms into the Dark Warrior Program's ultimate goal, Dark Jak. He breaks the binds and then returns to normal, after speaking his first words, ""I'm going to kill Praxis!""

Most citizens of ServaCor and the millions of other cities just like it hate their rulers. The corporations provide the citizens with free food, beer, shelter, junc, and flow in exchange for what is almost slave labor in huge robot factories. Most people are not happy with their situation, they see these ""free"" provisions as thinly masked ways to keep the citizens in line.

44570,7035,Ketsui: Kizuna Jigoku Tachi,"In the year 2054, chaos spreads over the globe as global warming finally exacts its toll on Earth: the ice caps quickly melt, causing a tremendous series of cataclysms and for entire nations to disappear under the sea. The near apocalyptic setting and the quickly depleting resources of the remaining dry lands force nations into constant war, eventually culminating into World War III; all efforts by the United Nations to cease hostilities are thwarted by a seemingly endless supply of technologically advanced weaponry being sold to each side of every conflict. After investigation, the source is tracked back to EVAC Industry co. ltd, an arms dealer who's been reaping tremendously high profits from the situation, at times directly intervening to fuel the hostilities with utter disregard towards human lives; any attempt to negotiate with the board of directors has utterly failed, the earnings having proven high enough for the company to build its own cities, shipyards, defensive emplacements and even a private airport, to the point of assembling its own army of extremely well equipped mercenary troops.

Being unable to enter the fray officially, the UN sets up a strike team of four pilots, each pair given one of two advanced helicopters: the plan is to simulate a rebellion within EVAC forces and bring down the company's headquarters, where research on a series of tremendous warmachines is taking place; for this reason, the planes both bear EVAC insignia and callsigns and are built according to stolen prototype blueprints - by no means, in success or failure, must the operation be traced back to the United Nations. However, for all this secrecy to be effective, even in victories the assault choppers will have to be destroyed... and the pilots killed. However, to compensate for their sacrifice, the UN shall fulfill one of their wishes, no matter what it is. And this, on board a stolen EVAC carrier plane, is how the story begins...",2003-01-28 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

152092,5901,Legacy of Kain: Defiance,"Defiance continues from where Soul Reaver 2 ended. In Soul Reaver 2, Kain saved Raziel's life by drawing the Soul Reaver from him - Raziel was meant to enter the blade and become its soul-devouring spectral half. This causes a paradox that changes time for the worse, and separates Kain and Raziel. 
 
Kain's part of the game follows him seeking Moebius the Time Streamer, a time traveling mystic for answers to where Raziel is, how he has changed time, and later following a lead Moebius gives him to explore a Vampire citadel. During his quest, Kain finds and completes a broken talisman of Vampire construct known as the Balance Emblem. Kain discovers murals during his quest dictating an ancient war between the first races to inhabit Nosgoth, the Ancient vampires and the Hylden. After sealing the Hylden in an alternate dimension using the Pillars of Nosgoth, the Hylden cursed the Ancients with blood-thirst, sterility and immortality, turning them into the first Vampires.

195855,1971,Manhunt,"The game takes place in the gritty crime-infested Carcer City. The story opens with a female journalist reporting on the convict James Earl Cash, a criminal on death row who has supposedly been executed by lethal injection. Cash is awoken to the voice of a person coming from an earpiece, revealing that Cash was only sedated. Cash puts on the earpiece and the person, who refers to himself as ""The Director"", promises Cash his freedom before the night is over, but only if Cash follows the Director's instructions. Released in a dingy neighborhood, Cash is directed to slaughter his way through the streets, populated by a gang calling themselves The Hoods while the Director, watching through security cameras scattered throughout the city, repeatedly mentions the need to please the audiences, revealing his occupation as a snuff film director. However, despite the Director's promise of freedom, Cash is beaten and thrown into the back of a van by a group of mercenaries known as the Cerberus.

After his battle against the Hoods, he is also hunted by other violent gangs in various locations across the city. The gangs are organized by Ramirez, an ex-soldier and leader of the Wardogs, a gang of army veterans and experienced hunters. First, Cash is pitted against a gang of white supremacists known as The Skinz in a scrap yard. After that, faces off against Ramirez's Wardogs in an abandoned zoo where Cash has to save kidnapped members of his own family. Following the zoo encounter, Cash is forced to battle a gang of devil worshipers and perverts known as the The Innocentz in an abandoned mall. After retrieving a video tape in the mall and finding a VCR player, Cash witnesses his family being slaughtered by The Innocentz. Betrayed, Cash is forced to endure the humiliating task of escorting a drunken hobo through the hostile streets of East Los Albos. After finishing off the Innocentz in a derelict chemical factory, Cash takes on a gang of psychotics, known as The Smileys, who have taken over a mental asylum. Here, Cash survives the ending to the snuff film as planned by the Director. Consequently, the remaining Wardogs and Ramirez are hired to kill Cash. However, Ramirez and his gang are killed by Cash, and Cash quickly turns on the Director.

The Carcer City Police Department (CCPD), are working for the Director; the CCPD are ordered by the Director to re-capture or kill Cash. However, the journalist seen at the game's beginning encounters Cash and imparts that she is on a mission to expose the Director's snuff film industry and CCPD corruption, and that Cash is vital for this important task; the journalist also reveals the Director's name is Starkweather. Protecting her from the police, Cash manages to take the journalist safely to her apartment, but Cash himself is re-captured by Cerberus. Back at Starkweather's mansion, he is ordered to be killed by Cerberus. However, Piggsy, an insane, chainsaw-wielding man, who wears a pig's head as a mask and was kept chained up in Starkweather's attic, has broken free and slaughters the investigating Cerberus. This allows Cash to work his way through the garden and mansion, killing the Cerberus leader along the way. Cash finally reaches the upper levels of the mansion, where he and Piggsy stalk one another. Cash triumphs after luring Piggsy onto a trapdoor that collapses, and as Piggsy tries to hold on, Cash chainsaws Piggsy's hands off, sending Piggsy falling to his death. After hacking his way through the last of the Cerberus, Cash finally confronts Starkweather and despite his pleas, brutally disembowels and decapitates him with the chainsaw. Soon, the press turns up at the mansion with the journalist exposing Starkweather's snuff ring and the police's involvement in Starkweather's operations.

She performed errands for the other Ga-Matoran and spoke with Nixie, who showed her a formula to find coordinates based on the six Toa. Nokama, recently returned from a Turaga meeting, announced the villages would hold a Kolhii Tournament, and chose Hahli over Kotu to play for Ga-Koro, with Macku as her defense player. While talking with the other Ga-Matoran, Hahli received the Charm from Shasa representing Unity, the Speed Charm from Kai, and the Purity Charm from Marka. Pelagia took Hahli into Naho Bay to swim with a Takea to improve her Speed. When Onepu and Taipu came to play the Ga-Matoran, Hahli used her Speed to get the better of the team. The Onu-Matoran invited her to Onu-Koro, where she explored the Marn Tunnels. After diving in the now flooded Great Mine to recover mining equipment, she helped Azibo recover his Sluice, and he gave Hahli the Prosperity Charm in return. Taipu trained Hahli in the Onu-Matoran discipline of Stamina and gave her its Charm. Hahli also met Nuparu, who gave her fitness check-ups.

Hahli had to go to Ko-Koro for the approaching Kolhii match. While exploring, she met Jaatikko and Toudo, who gave her the Destiny Charm and Peace Charm, respectively. Hahli traversed The Drifts and found Kantai, who trained her in Willpower and gave her its Charm. Using Willpower and Stamina, Hahli defeated Matoro and Kopeke in the match. Arriving in Le-Koro, Hahli was greeted by Kongu and Matau and found the Faith Charm. During training in Accuracy with Bamboo Disks under Tamaru, Hahli found the Accuracy Charm. Using her improved Accuracy, Hahli won the match against Kongu and Tamaru, and left for Po-Koro. In Po-Koro, she learned about Creation from Hewkii and found its Charm. She practiced in Strategy with Golyo by herding Mahi and also found its Charm. In the subsequent match, she used her new skills to defeat Hafu and Hewkii. Leaving the village, she travelled to Ta-Koro to play Jaller and Takua, and Jaller directed her to Keahi to train in Strength. After learning about the last Principle of Courage from Kapura, she used her full knowledge of the Skills and Principles to defeat Ta-Koro, securing a spot in the Championship.

In the Championship, the Ga-Koro team played against Po-Koro and Ta-Koro at the Ta-Koro Kolhii Stadium, and Hahli and Macku won narrowly. At the end of the game, the Mask of Light slipped out of Jaller's bag, leading the Turaga to proclaim Jaller the herald of the Seventh Toa and set him upon a quest. Hahli wanted to speak to Jaller, but he had to leave quickly on his quest. Trying to find him, she found the Courage Charm in Jaller's home the and Duty Charm at the Wall of History. She returned to Ga-Koro and looked at the formula Nixie had showed her. Because of the announcement of the Seventh Toa, she used seven as the base number instead six, calculating a coordinate in Naho Bay. Pelagia sailed her to the coordinate, and Hahli found the Temple of Purity in the ocean She located the Crystal of Purity deep in the ocean, and unlocked its Temple with the Charms. After showing the Crystal to Nixie, Hahli went to find the other temples. In Onu-Koro, Hahli swam again in the Great Mine, diving to the bottom to find the Temple of Prosperity. Unlocking it, she retrieved the Crystal of Prosperity and swam back up to the surface. The Drifts contained the Temple of Peace, a grouping of three statues Hahli unlocked to reveal another Crystal. In Le-Wahi, the highest tree-top contained the Temple of Faith, and using Charms she retrieved the Crystal of Faith. The Temple of Creation was a statue half covered in sand in Po-Wahi, that Hahli entered to retrieve the Crystal of Creation. With five Crystals, Hahli returned to Ta-Koro to look for the final Temple, Charm, and Crystal.

Arrival of the Rahkshi

Hahli unlocking the Crystal's secret
Three Rahkshi suddenly attacked Ta-Koro, but Hahli was able to raise the bridge so the Matoran could escape. Confronted by Lerahk, she fled Ta-Koro as it was destroyed and ran into Ta-Wahi. Hahli stumbled upon the Temple of Courage and found Courage's Charm. Using it to enter the Temple, she found the last Crystal. Wandering the Ta-Wahi Beach, Hahli found the Great Telescope and a carving of The Legend of Mata Nui. Noticing slots in the carving, Hahli inserted the Crystals, and was teleported to Kini-Nui where she watched as three more Rahkshi flew overhead.

When Jaller died and Takua transformed into Takanuva, Hahli mourned Jaller deeply. Once the Toa built the Ussanui, she placed his mask upon the helm to lead Takanuva to victory and a new light. She then hid in the Ussanui and traveled with Takanuva into Mangaia for his conflict with Makuta Teridax. There, Takanuva sent her to bring the other Turaga and Toa Nuva from the surface. This incited quarreling among the islanders, whom Hahli quieted with a hopeful speech about Jaller and the Three Virtues. After Takanuva defeated Teridax and transformed with him into Takutanuva, he lifted the gate for the Matoran. When Hahli ran by with Jaller's mask, Takutanuva stopped her and gave up part of his life force to bring Jaller back to life. Takutanuva then perished, and Takanuva emerged from the rubble of the gate.

Hahli was given the position of Chronicler by Nokama, and was one of a handful of Matoran who witnessed the Turaga tell the tales of their adventures as Toa Metru and Toa Hordika, recording the legends in her position as Chronicler.",2003-06-26 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

181778,26359,MU Online,"In a millennium's time, the Land of MU has advanced and developed the empire in great bounding strides. However, as foretold in the Great Prophecy, Secromicon, the Continent of MU fell into overwhelming chaos. Great leaders who had once controlled the MU Continent now have fallen low, and the central government; due to the internal strife and warfare amongst power hungry feudal lords, have brought the kingdom asunder and thus the empire crumbled. The millennium of peace and bounty is now a mere memory and dark stains of blood now cover the land. The ravages of war have laid waste to the once beautiful land and the shedding of blood still knows no end. Even now, petty feudal lords endlessly build up their machines of war and futilely attempt to re-establish what once was.

And it was during this time of endless blood letting that the Gates of Hell were thrown open as the blind ambitions of a foolish man had been led far astray.

Antonias a foolish Lord, blinded by ambition, deceived by the evil Sorceress Lemulia, unknowingly let loose upon the world, Kundun, the Devil of Darkness, a demon difficultly confined by the Seal of Etramu.

""Now this land shall be mine again. I have banished Peace for all time… the Sun will no longer shine. This earth shall be mine, and cunning men will be my slaves and cattle.""

The Ancient Devil Kundun awake from its long sleepless slumber now walks amongst the living defiling the land with his touch. Amidst the chaos, the stars have lost their course and the stench of fear and blood pervades throughout. Kundun released upon the land his rage and vengeance for his long confinement. Quickly, the now forsaken land of MU has become home to Kundun's minions and for 2 long years the evil of his reign befouled all that was once pure. Nightmare's Day, a passage in the Great Prophecy, had come true and was no longer merely the words of days gone by. Wise men began their studies anew and hopingly and longingly referred to the ray of light mentioned within the writings of the prophecy. Their last remaining hope lay in the power of the seal of Etramu, the very seal that maintained Kundun's imprisonment. Into 8 pieces the seal has been scattered and only when the seal is made whole shall peace return to the land once more.",2003-10-06 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,62.6338,14

Revolution,"In Phantasy Star Online Episodes I and II, the spaceship Pioneer 2 arrived at the uninhabited planet Ragol in hopes of colonization in response to the failing ecosystem of the home planet Coral. In Episode III, Pioneer 2 remains in orbit above Ragol, but still has not begun colonization. The inner strife of the government of Pioneer 2, which has since gained independence from Coral, in addition to the exploitation of the planet's resources prevent colonization. 
 
The government of Pioneer 2 also hopes to exploit ""the germ"", a mysterious substance discovered on the planet, which they use to power the newly developed ""C.A.R.D. technology"", which is used to store items such as weapons as cards and allow them to be used much more efficiently.[1] C.A.R.D. is an acronym for ""compressed alternate reality data"". The game can be played as either the ""Heroside"" or the ""Darkside"". The ""Heroside"" are government-appointed officials, who take orders from the government to explore, research, and capture the Arkz, an anti-government faction. The ""Darkside"" are the Arkz, founded by a man known only as Red. The Arkz try to intercept and destroy the government's plans for the exploitation of the planet. They also oppose the use of C.A.R.D. technology due to its unpredictability and the lack of complete understanding of the germ. They still, however, use a stolen version of the technology in order to be able to compete with Heroside. Both sides also search for the location of the ""Great Shadow"", which is believed to be the source of the germ. 
 
Within the two factions, each character has their own goals and aspirations, and playing as certain characters in battle will reveal different aspects of the story. When both sides of the story are completed, one after another, it is discovered that the government, while experimenting with the germ for clone technology, is attempting to create bio-soldiers with the genetic material of Red's deceased twin daughters. The final boss for Heroside is a rejected mutated clone of Pollux. The final boss for Darkside is a rejected mutated clone of the other twin, Castor. After completing the storylines and their boss battles, there is a final battle with the source of the germ, Amplam Umbra. Once the source is destroyed, Pioneer 2 finally lands on Ragol, and the colonization of the planet begins.",2003-11-27 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,74.0000,2

The group eventually gains enough hair from various animals throughout the forest to dress themselves as scarecrow-like Hoodlums. In the middle of the process, Murfy, one of the residents and workers of the Fairy Council, discovers them. André later discovers him hiding nearby, and he and his Black Lums pursue him. Murfy is chased to a small clearing, where Rayman and his friend Globox are sound asleep. Just after Murfy reaches them, Globox is awakened by the commotion. Now aware of the situation, Globox helps Murfy to try and get Rayman, who is still asleep, to safety. In the process, Globox accidentally removes Rayman's hands, forcing Murfy to pick Rayman up by his hair and fly him away from the clearing himself. In an attempt to save himself, Globox runs away to safety, taking Rayman's hands along with him.",2003-02-21 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,30.0000,2,40.0000,4

He then chases Murfy until they stumble upon Rayman and his friend Globox, peacefully resting under a tree. Attempting to hide Rayman up in the tree, Globox grabs the limbless hero's hands, and they naturally come right off. Globox then runs away, and Rayman goes and retrieves his hands.

Andre then proceeds to the heart of the world, and Rayman goes to stop him. He manages to head him off, but the lum flies straight into Globox's mouth and gets stuck in his stomach! The duo sets out for a doctor's office, where the expert can supposedly get Andre out. Unfortunately, the doctor's musical treatment fails to get the villain out, and he then refers them to another doctor. The second doctor refers them to yet another doctor, and finally the three doctors team up and get Andre out.

Of course, they were unable to catch Andre before he flew away, and so he sets out to take over the world and destroy Rayman. Of course, Rayman sets out to stop him once and for all.",2003-02-21 00:00:00.000,35,NULL,65.0000,2,78.4976,92

Algol is ruled by King Lassic, who while originally benevolent, becomes a cruel, sociopathic tyrant. After a string of harsh political changes, small pockets of rebellion emerge but are mostly ineffective against Lassic's iron rule. One such rebel named Nero is killed by Lassic's forces, and his sister Alis swears revenge. Alis builds a party of adventurers including a warrior named Odin,[b] a wizard named Noah,[c] and a catlike creature named Myau. Together, they embark on an adventure spanning the three planets, meeting with townspeople, battling enemies, and finding special items that will help in the fight against Lassic. Eventually, the party engages and defeats Lassic, after which an ethereal voice tells them to return to Motavia. There, they encounter a more evil force, Dark Falz, and after destroying him, finally return peace to the Algol system.",2003-09-28 00:00:00.000,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Frustrated at his inability to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, Eggman dumped it at Emerald Beach where it was found once more, this time by Sonic the Hedgehog.

Sonic names the Gizoid ""Emerl"", who gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic's friends, both allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, Gamma, Rouge, and Shadow, Emerl turns from a soulless robot into a fun-loving mech with personality traits from all of those he had met. But while the gang is having fun raising their new mechanical friend, there are those who recognize Emerl's true power. Now that Emerl is working again, Eggman has his eye on it, Rouge wants to turn it into a master thief, and Shadow feels that, despite Sonic's efforts to humanize him, Emerl is still a weapon of mass destruction.",2003-12-04 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,75.0000,1,60.8918,25

143665,22248,Space Colony,"Space Colony is a strategy game with two basic levels of management. On one level you have to manage a futuristic base, while on the other you have to manage the relationships between the crew members who inhabit the base. It clearly draws inspiration from Maxis' popular life-simulator The Sims (just take a look at the box cover), as well as from management games like RollerCoaster Tycoon, SimGolf, and FireFly's own Stronghold series.

Though it has no multiplayer, the game does offer a great deal of content in the form of a comprehensive single-player campaign, a series of skirmish missions, and an open-ended sandbox mode. Plus, there's a map editor you can use to create your own levels. While Space Colony offers a great deal of breadth, and a surprising amount of depth, it never really capitalizes on either of these strengths to become an incredibly compelling or incredibly enjoyable game.",2003-08-29 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,77.0000,3,64.7749,6

SpongeBob and Patrick were playing with toy robots and wish they would with real robots. Patrick uses his ""magic wishing shell"" to make their wish come true, hoping they will show up tomorrow. SpongeBob wakes up to find that his house has been trashed after thinking he wants to play with a robot. He wanders through the house for a while and receives a fax from Mr. Krabs, stating that he would give SpongeBob a golden spatula for every certain amount of shiny objects he collects for him. Outside, SpongeBob finds a disappointed Plankton, who weaves a tale of lies to the hero, claiming that the robots showed up out of nowhere and kicked him out. Fooled by the diminutive villain, SpongeBob embarks on a perilous quest to find golden spatulas, get rid of the robots, trading shiny objects to Mr. Krabs for golden spatulas, searching for Patrick's stolen socks (that had been taken by the robots) who will give him golden spatulas if he brings back ten socks, and getting Plankton back into the Chum Bucket, including bungee jumping, bubble blowing, learning new bubble moves from Bubble Buddy, and traveling through dreams amongst others.",2003-10-31 00:00:00.000,5,NULL,100.0000,1,81.3302,52

Former Jedi Darth Malak, a Dark Lord of the Sith and Darth Revan's former apprentice, has unleashed a Sith armada against the Republic. Malak's aggression has left the Jedi scattered and vulnerable; many Jedi Knights have fallen in battle and others have sworn allegiance to Malak.

The game opens with the player's character - the player can choose a face and be male or female (canonically a male) - awakening aboard the Republic ship, Endar Spire, which is under attack by Malak's forces.

136495,314,SWAT: Global Strike Team,"SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM was formed in 2008 in response to an unprecedented escalation of threats of violence against civilians around the world by a well-organized and highly ruthless transnational criminal network bent on destabilizing democracy for its own benefit.

In a secret crisis summit of the UN Security Council in Moscow, the leaders of the free world unanimously agreed that the best way to engage this common foe was to form a global police force whose structure could parallel or mirror that of the criminal network itself.

SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM is composed of the cream of police officers from the best tactical units in the world, including some who served in OPERATION URBAN JUSTICE in previous years, as well as ex-special forces personnel from various militaries. It is based on the concept that different nationalities with knowledge of local criminal environments can readily pool their intelligence and expertise to anticipate and prevent the enemy from achieving their goals. Those selected for SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM do tours of duty around the world before returning to their previous vocations. Most choose to stay...

SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM is the muscle, the business end of a worldwide policy to streamline the law enforcement agencies of civilized nations in a sustained effort to coordinate a response to the real threat posed by the criminal network. SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM was therefore designed to work alongside more traditional law enforcement agencies and military/defense organizations throughout the world.

You are Mathias Kincaid, a former member of the US Army's elite Delta Force and now a commander within SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM. Having volunteered for GST duty, your wish has finally been granted. As element leader, you will be teamed up with two first lieutenants, a sharpshooting sniper named Kana Lee, and Anthony ""TJ"" Jackson, an excellent field technician.

A major threat to world security has arisen: two rival gangs, the ""Omega Cartel"" (Executive High Rollers) and the ""Whispering Dragon Clan"" (Urban Street Warriors) - in reality organizations - are fighting a bitter turf war over the production and distribution of a deadly new designer drug, LD-50 - nicknamed SPIKE. The Omega Cartel owns the production and distribution arm, but the new boys on the street, the Dragons, want to tax the Omega Cartel or gain access to their territory.

This war has spilled out onto the streets of the world's major cities, terrorizing ordinary decent citizens. Airports have been closed down due to bomb threats, waves of car bomb attacks have swept the US, Europe, and the former Soviet Union, and street gunfights have spread beyond LA into the heartland of the US. In several major European cities, huge areas are considered virtual war zones and have effectively been abandoned by conventional police forces.

To meet this threat, a global police response is needed. And so SWAT: GLOBAL STRIKE TEAM is called in with orders to destroy both narco-terrorist organizations.",2003-10-28 00:00:00.000,1,NULL,64.5000,3,NULL,NULL

He appears to be trapped and left for dead. Ayame stuck Rikimaru's sword, ""Izayoi"" (he is seen drawing this sword in the opening CG of Wrath of Heaven) in snow as a monument for her fellow ninja, now considered dead. A year later, Rikimaru reports to Lord Gohda that he has managed to survive this near-death experience; unbeknownst to them, the real Rikimaru is trapped in the 20th century trying to find a way back to their time. 
 
The game's plot plays differently depending on the character chosen, but connects at certain points. The story revolves mainly around Rikimaru's return and the struggle for the Three Jewels, which are said to give power to those who possess them. These are the Jewels of Heaven, Earth, and Virtue. Tenrai, an evil wizard who wants to get his hands on them, commands a band of his men to take the Jewels from whoever possesses them. However, upon encountering Rikimaru, he seems interested in his power and attempts convincing him to join his men. Rikimaru refuses, and he and Ayame face each one of them. One of the men in Tenrai's arsenal is Onikage, who only serves him to pursue his plan of reviving Mei-Oh (his former master) and Tatsumaru (the former leader of the Azuma Ninja Clan whom Tenrai revived). Rikimaru and Ayame follow Tenrai into his fortress to stop him from destroying the world using the power gained from two of the Jewels.

In Gensokyo, people relax and bask in the calm of a winter without end. Spring has shown no sign of arriving even though it's already May, and in fact the snowstorms are continually getting worse. Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine, is tired of being cold day in and day out and wants to find the source of this unnatural weather. Marisa Kirisame, a black-clothed magician, sees a cherry blossom petal float down outside her warm house and wonders if spring is happening somewhere else. Sakuya Izayoi, the maid leader of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, knows that their winter supplies are diminishing quickly, and wants to end this prolonged winter before they run out completely. Depending on who you choose, only one of these three heroines actually goes out and investigates.

MAIN STORY
The heroine starts off her journey by heading off into the snow-covered forests in search of clues. She battles the ice fairy Cirno and the winter spirit Letty Whiterock in the forest, and the nekomata Chen in the village of Mayohiga, without any progress in her search. Finally, after defeating Alice Margatroid and her dolls, the heroine finds a lead when she notices several cherry blossoms blowing around in the sky. The heroine follows the trail of cherry blossoms high above Gensokyo, breaking through the greetings of Lily White, eventually reaching a great magical boundary and the poltergeist musicians Prismriver Sisters. After silencing the Prismriver Sisters, the heroine crosses the boundary into the Netherworld.

After fighting off several ghosts, the heroine is confronted by human-ghost gardener Youmu Konpaku. Youmu explains that she had been stealing the essence of ""spring"" throughout Gensokyo in order to make the Saigyou Ayakashi, a youkai cherry tree, bloom perfectly with the rest of Hakugyokurou's gardens, as per her master's orders. The heroine defeats Youmu and hurries to Hakugyokurou to get Gensokyo's spring back. Now at the end of a long journey, the heroine comes face to face with Yuyuko Saigyouji, the ghost princess of Hakugyokurou. Yuyuko reveals that she wanted to revive a certain soul that has been sealed within the Saigyou Ayakashi from before her existence. In order to break the seal, the youkai cherry blossom tree needed to bloom fully and completely. Yuyuko and the heroine wage a fierce battle, to get the last ""spring"" contained in the heroine needed for the Perfect Cherry Blossom, and to reclaim Gensokyo's spring, respectively. After the heroine defeats Yuyuko, the Saigyou Ayakashi starts to lose its health. However the seal has been weakened from the near-complete bloom, and the sealed soul is temporarily unleashed. The soul is actually Yuyuko's. The heroine dodges attack after attack until Yuyuko's soul is finally sealed once more.",2003-08-17 00:00:00.000,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,80.3040,17

The ORA then murder Richard, and abduct Emma as a mortal bride for Zeus so that he can gain complete power over the mortal world which, unsurprisingly, drives Will over the edge and leaves him in a rather unpleasant position.
